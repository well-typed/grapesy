# Demo client

The code for the demo can be found in [`demo/Main.hs`](/demo-client/Main.hs). It
is based on the examples from the [gRPC docs](https://grpc.io/docs/). We will
mostly refer to the [Python version](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/) of
these examples, as it is the most complete, although we will also provide some
pointers for testing against the [C++
version](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/cpp/).

In the explanations below, `grpc-repo` refers to a local checkout of the [gRPC
repo](https://github.com/grpc/grpc). These instructions are based on commit hash
[358bfb5](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/358bfb581feeda5bf17dd3b96da1074d84a6ef8d).

## Protobuf

All of these examples use the Protobuf instantiation of `gRPC`. On the Haskell
side, `.proto` files are compiled using
[`proto-lens-protoc`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/proto-lens-protoc).
This uses type-level symbols to refer to service methods; one minor pecularity
here is that it turns the first letter of the method name to lowercase. For
example, `helloworld.Greeter.SayHello` becomes

```haskell
Protobuf @Greeter @"sayHello"
```

## TLS

See https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/#python for the changes required to the
Python code to enable TLS.

To connect over TLS, run the client with `--secure`:

```
cabal run demo-client -- sayHello --name 'John' --secure
```

By default this sets up the `demo-server`'s certificate as a root, so that the
client can verify the certificate. See the command line flags for details.

## Quick start

### `helloworld.Greeter.SayHello`

Haskell implementation: `greeterSayHello`.

Assumes running server:

* If testing against `grapesy`'s own demo-server, see `demo-server.md`.

* If testing against example Python server:

  ```
  grpc-repo/examples/python/helloworld$ python3 greeter_server.py
  ```

* If testing against example C++ server:

  ```
  grpc-repo/examples/cpp/helloworld/cmake/build$ ./greeter_server
  ```

Run client with

```
cabal run demo-client -- sayHello --name 'John'
```

The output will be slightly different depending on which server you use.

### Testing low-level details

We can also send _multiple_ messages:

```
cabal run demo-client -- \
  sayHello --name 'John' \
  sayHello --name 'Alice'
```

optionally with pauses:

```
cabal run demo-client -- \
  sayHello --name 'John' \
  --delay 5 \
  sayHello --name 'Alice'
```

#### Compression

This can be interesting for example to verify that compression is working
properly (the first message will be sent without compression since it's not yet
known what compression schemes the server supports, but subsequent messages
should then be compressed). However, it takes a bit of effort to make the server
actually compress anything:

* You need to enable compression in the server; for the Python one, see
  https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/examples/python/compression/README.md
* You need to send a "name" that is long enough that the server actually
  bothers with compression at all.
* You can also use the `--gzip`, `--deflate`, or `--snappy` command line flags
  to tell the server to *only* use GZip, Deflate, or Snappy compression,
  respectively.

For example:

```
cabal run demo-client -- --gzip \
  sayHello --name 'John' \
  sayHello --name '0xxxxxxxxxx1xxxxxxxxxx2xxxxxxxxxx3xxxxxxxxxx4xxxxxxxxxx5xxxxxxxxxx'
```

Of course, the compression is transparent to the user, but you can observe it
in Wireshark.

#### Automatic reconnect

The `grapesy` implementation of `gRPC` supports
[wait for ready](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/wait-for-ready.md)
semantics, meaning that if the server cannot be reached, the connection will
automatically be retried. This is disabled by default (as per the spec), but the
demo client enables it, trying at most 10x to connect to a server, using
exponential backoff as the reconnection policy.

Closely related, the same reconnection policy then also enables automatic
reconnects, which means the client will re-establish a connection to a server
after it has lost it.

We can observe both using the demo client and server. Start the client without
the server:

```
cabal run demo-client -- \
  sayHello --name 'John' \
  --delay 5 \
  sayHello --name 'Alice'
```

Then start the server; you should see the first `sayHello` method call happen:

```
{message: "Hello, John!"}
```

Now stop the server again, and the client will try to reconnect again. Finally,
if you now start the server again, the client should be able to connect again:

```
{message: "Hello, Alice!"}
```

This means that code can just create one `Connection` object and keep using it,
even in the presence of temporary network failures etc.: `grapesy` will
automatically reconnect. Of course, this is only true for _new_ RPC calls;
_existing_ calls will fail. To see this, we can run the `sayHelloBidiStream`
version of hello world, which uses a streaming RPC call, saying "hello" to each
name as they stream in (as opposed to making multiple RPC calls for each name).
Start the server again, and then run the client; after the first hello, stop
the server and start it again; the client will reconnect, but when it tries to
send the next message, an exception will be raised:

```
$ cabal run demo-client --  --core sayHelloBidiStream  \
  --name 'John' \
  --delay 10  \
  --name 'Joe' \
  --name 'Jay'
{message: "John Ack"}
Disconnected. Reconnecting after 1701081Î¼s
Reconnecting now.
demo-client: demo-client: ServerDisconnected {serverDisconnectedException = ..., ...}
```

### Dealing with unterminated streams

Normally the last message to the server is marked as `END_STREAM`. If this is
not the case, the server can still respond, but they will additionally send a
`RST_STREAM` frame to the client to indicate that the stream has ended.
To test this we can intentionally omit the `END_STREAM` marker:

```
cabal run demo-client -- --core-dont-mark-final sayHello --name 'John'
```

Wireshark can be used to observe the `END_STREAM` marker being sent
(note that this depends on https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/78).

### `helloworld.Greeter.SayHelloStreamReply`

Haskell implementation: `greeterSayHelloStreamReply`.

This is only implemented by a _single_ example server (the Python one). Run it
with

```
grpc-repo/examples/python/wait_for_ready$
  python3 wait_for_ready_with_client_timeout_example_server.py
```

Run client with

```
cabal run demo-client -- sayHelloStreamReply --name 'John'
```

The Python server has some intentional delays in there, so the streaming will be
relatively slow (delays on the order of seconds). Moreover, this example also
sends some metadata in the initial request. Metadata is not available using the
standard Protobuf API in grapesy; instead, we need to use the full client API.
The demo does this in the `Core` implementation:

```
cabal run demo-client -- --core sayHelloStreamReply --name 'John'
```

This should output something like:

```
# pause..
ResponseInitialMetadata (SayHelloMetadata (Just "initial-md-value"))
# pause..
{message: "Hello John times 0"}
{message: "Hello John times 1"}
{message: "Hello John times 2"}
NoMetadata
```

### `helloworld.Greeter.SayHelloBidiStream`

This is an illustration of cancellation
(https://grpc.io/docs/guides/cancellation/) and is only supported by the C++
example in `grpc-repo/examples/cpp/cancellation`. Provided the C++ server is
running, you can run the client with

```
cabal run demo-client -- --core sayHelloBidiStream \
  --name 'John' \
  --name 'Joe' \
  --name 'Jay'
```

## Route guide

Instructions below assume a running server:

```
grpc-repo/examples/python/route_guide$ python3 route_guide_server.py
```

or

```
grpc-repo/examples/cpp/route_guide$ cmake/build/route_guide_server
```

All methods except `getFeature` support the `--streamtype-conduit` option to use
the [`Conduit` interface](/src/Network/GRPC/Client/StreamType/Conduit.hs).

### `routeguide.RouteGuide.GetFeature` (non-streaming RPC)

Haskell implementation: `routeGuideGetFeature`.

Run client:

```
cabal run demo-client -- getFeature --latitude 409146138 --longitude -746188906
```

(for a location where there exists a feature), or

```
cabal run demo-client -- getFeature --latitude 0 --longitude 0
```

for a location where there is not.

### `routeguide.RouteGuide.ListFeatures` (server-side streaming)

Haskell implementation: `routeGuideListFeatures`.

Run client:

```
cabal run demo-client -- listFeatures \
    --lo-latitude   400000000 \
    --lo-longitude -750000000 \
    --hi-latitude   420000000 \
    --hi-longitude -730000000
```

#### Edge case: no features

An important edge case here is the case where there are zero features in
the specified rectangle:

```
cabal run demo-client -- listFeatures \
  --lo-latitude  0 \
  --lo-longitude 0 \
  --hi-latitude  0 \
  --hi-longitude 0
```

This is important because this triggers the gRPC `Trailers-Only` case despite
not being an error (strictly speaking this is not conform the gRPC spec).

This test can also be run with `--core`, in which case it shows the received
metadata. This is important, even though that metadata is empty, because it
requires some special care to treat that metadata correctly in this case; see
discussion in `Network.GRPC.Spec.Response`.

### `routeguide.RouteGuide.RecordRuite` (client-side streaming)

Haskell implementation: `routeGuideRecordRoute`.

Run client:

```
cabal run demo-client -- recordRoute \
  --latitude 404306372 --longitude -741079661 \
  --delay 0.5                                 \
  --latitude 406109563 --longitude -742186778 \
  --delay 0.5                                 \
  --latitude 417951888 --longitude -748484944 \
  --delay 0.5                                 \
  --latitude 411236786 --longitude -744070769 \
  --delay 0.5                                 \
  --latitude 409224445 --longitude -748286738 \
  --delay 0.5                                 \
  --latitude 407586880 --longitude -741670168 \
  --delay 0.5                                 \
  --latitude 415736605 --longitude -742847522 \
  --delay 0.5                                 \
  --latitude 411236786 --longitude -744070769 \
  --delay 0.5                                 \
  --latitude 400106455 --longitude -742870190 \
  --delay 0.5                                 \
  --latitude 404615353 --longitude -745129803
```

This should report something like

```
{point_count: 10 feature_count: 10 distance: 667689 elapsed_time: 4}
```

#### Edge case: empty route

One important edge case here is the empty route:

```
cabal run demo-client -- recordRoute
```

(This is effectively the equivalent of the  `Trailers-Only` case from the "no
features" edge case above, except of course that gRPC does not actually support
request trailers. Nonetheless, similar scenario.)

### `routeguide.RouteGuide.RouteChat` (bidirectional streaming)

Haskell implementation: `routeGuideRouteChat`.

This example is a bit strange; despite the name "chat" it does not actually
allow for communication between clients. Instead, the server will keep a history
of all notes received, and whenever it receives another note, it will output all
previous notes at that same location. So if you run the client with something
like this:

```
cabal run demo-client -- routeChat \
  --latitude 0 --longitude 0 'A' \
  --delay 1                      \
  --latitude 0 --longitude 0 'B' \
  --delay 1                      \
  --latitude 0 --longitude 0 'C' \
  --delay 1                      \
  --latitude 0 --longitude 0 'D' \
  --delay 1                      \
  --latitude 0 --longitude 1 'E' \
  --delay 1                      \
  --latitude 0 --longitude 1 'F' \
  --delay 1                      \
  --latitude 0 --longitude 1 'G' \
  --delay 1                      \
  --latitude 0 --longitude 0 'H'
```

you will get this output:

```
Sending {location { } message: "A"}
Delay 1.0s

Sending {location { } message: "B"}
Delay 1.0s
{location { } message: "A"}

Sending {location { } message: "C"}
Delay 1.0s
{location { } message: "A"}
{location { } message: "B"}

Sending {location { } message: "D"}
Delay 1.0s
{location { } message: "A"}
{location { } message: "B"}
{location { } message: "C"}

Sending {location { longitude: 1 } message: "E"}
Delay 1.0s

Sending {location { longitude: 1 } message: "F"}
Delay 1.0s
{location { longitude: 1 } message: "E"}

Sending {location { longitude: 1 } message: "G"}
Delay 1.0s
{location { longitude: 1 } message: "E"}
{location { longitude: 1 } message: "F"}

Sending {location { } message: "H"}
{location { } message: "A"}
{location { } message: "B"}
{location { } message: "C"}
{location { } message: "D"}
```

**Note**: The C++ implementation of this server seems buggy: new clients that
connect sometimes (randomly?) get state from old clients. The Python client does
not do this.
