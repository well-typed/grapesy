  Execution mode

-- | Execution mode
--
-- Each test involves one or more pairs of a client and a server engaged in an
-- RPC call. Each call consists of a series of actions ("client sends initial
-- metadata", "client sends a message", "server sends a message", etc.). We
-- categorize such actions as either " passive " (such as receiving a message)
-- or " active " (such as sending a message).
--
-- As part of the test generation, each action is assigned a (test) clock tick.
-- This imposes a specific (but randomly generated) ordering; this matches the
-- formal definition of the behaviour of concurrent systems: "for every
-- interleaving, ...". Active actions wait until the test clock (essentially
-- such an @MVar Int@) reaches their assigned tick before proceeding. The
-- /advancement/ of the test clock depends on the mode (see below).
data ExecutionMode =
    -- | Conservative mode (used when tests involve early termination)
    --
    -- == Ordering
    --
    -- Consider a test that looks something like:
    --
    -- > clock tick 1: client sends message
    -- > clock tick 2: client throws exception
    --
    -- We have to be careful to preserve ordering here: the exception thrown by
    -- the client may or may not " overtake " the earlier send: the message may
    -- or may not be send to the server, thereby making the tests flaky. In
    -- conversative mode, therefore, the /passive/ participant is the one that
    -- advances the test clock; in the example above, the /server/ advances the
    -- test clock when it receives the message. The downside of this approach
    -- is that we are excluding some valid behaviour from the tests: we're
    -- effectively making every operation synchronous.
    --
    -- == Connection isolation
    --
    -- The tests assume that different calls are independent from each other.
    -- This is mostly true, but not completely: when a client or a server
    -- terminates early, the entire connection (supporting potentially many
    -- calls) is reset. It's not entirely clear why; it feels like an
    -- unnecessary limitation in @http2@. (TODO: Actually, this might be related
    -- to an exception being thrown in 'outboundTrailersMaker'?)
    --
    -- Ideally, we would either (1) randomly assign connections to calls and
    -- then test that an early termination only affects calls using the same
    -- connection, or better yet, (2), remove this limitation from @http2@.
    --
    -- For now, we do neither: /if/ a test includes early termination, we give
    -- each call its own connection, thereby regaining independence.
    Conservative

    -- | Aggressive mode (used when tests do not involve early termination)
    --
    -- == Ordering
    --
    -- Consider a test containing:
    --
    -- > clock tick 1: client sends message A
    -- > clock tick 2: client sends message B
    --
    -- In aggressive mode it's the /active/ participant that advances the clock.
    -- This means that we may well reach clock tick 2 before the server has
    -- received message A, thus testing the asynchronous nature of the
    -- operations that @grapesy@ offers
    --
    -- ## Connection isolation
    --
    -- In aggressive mode all calls from the client to the server share the
    -- same connection.
