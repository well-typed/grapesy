  Initiate request

  Control flow and exception handling here is a little tricky.

  * 'sendRequest' (coming from @http2@) will itself spawn a separate thread to
    deal with sending inputs to the server (here, that is 'sendMessageLoop').

  * As the last thing it does, 'sendRequest' will then call its continuation
    argument in whatever thread it was called. Here, that continuation argument
    is 'recvMessageLoop' (dealing with outputs sent by the server), which we
    want to run in a separate thread also. We must therefore call 'sendRequest'
    in a newly forked thread.

    Note that 'sendRequest' will /only/ call its continuation once it receives
    a response from the server. Some servers will not send the (start of the)
    response until it has received (part of) the request, so it is important
    that we do not wait on 'sendRequest' before we return control to the caller.

  * We need to decide what to do with any exceptions that might arise in these
    threads. One option might be to rethrow those exceptions to the parent
    thread, but this presupposes a certain level of hygiene in client code: if
    the client code spawns threads of their own, and shares the open RPC call
    between them, then we rely on the client code to propagate the exception
    further.

    We therefore choose a different approach: we do not try to propagate the
    exception at all, but instead ensure that any (current or future) call to
    'read' or 'write' (or 'push') on the open 'Peer' will result in an exception
    when the respective threads have died.

  * This leaves one final problem to deal with: if setting up the request
    /itself/ throws an exception, one or both threads might never get started.
    To avoid client code blocking indefinitely we will therefore catch any
    exceptions that arise during the call setup, and use them to 'cancel' both
    threads (which will kill them or ensure they never get started).

-- | No trailers
--
-- We do not support outbound trailers in the client. This simplifies control
-- flow: when the inbound stream closes (because the server terminates the RPC),
-- we kill the outbound thread; by not supporting outbound trailers, we avoid
-- that exception propagating to the trailers maker, which causes http2 to
-- panic and shut down the entire connection.
