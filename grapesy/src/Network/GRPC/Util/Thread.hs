-- | Get the thread's interface

--
-- * blocks if the thread in case of 'ThreadNotStarted' or 'ThreadInitializing'
-- * throws 'ThreadInterfaceUnavailable' in case of 'ThreadException'.
-- * returns the thread interface otherwise
--
-- We do /not/ distinguish between 'ThreadDone' and 'ThreadRunning' here, as
-- doing so is inherently racy (we might return that the client is still
-- running, and then it terminates before the calling code can do anything with
-- that information).
--
-- NOTE: This turns off deadlock detection for the duration of the transaction.
-- It should therefore only be used for transactions that can never be blocked
-- indefinitely.
--
-- Usage note: in practice we use this to interact with threads that in turn
-- interact with @http2@ (running 'sendMessageLoop' or 'recvMessageLoop').
-- Although calls into @http2@ may in fact block indefinitely, we will /catch/
-- those exception and treat them as network failures. If a @grapesy@ function
-- ever throws a "blocked indefinitely" exception, this should be reported as a
-- bug in @grapesy@.
