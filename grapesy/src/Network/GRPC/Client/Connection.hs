  Connection API

  'Connection' is kept abstract (opaque) in the user facing API.

  The closest concept on the server side concept is
  'Network.GRPC.Server.Context': this does not identify a connection from a
  particular client (@http2@ gives us each request separately, without
  identifying which requests come from the same client), but keeps track of the
  overall server state.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------}

-- | Open connection to server
--
-- See 'withConnection'.
--
-- Before we can send RPC requests, we have to connect to a specific server
-- first. Once we have opened a connection to that server, we can send as many
-- RPC requests over that one connection as we wish. 'Connection' abstracts over
-- this connection, and also maintains some information about the server.
--
-- We can make many RPC calls over the same connection.

-- | Open connection to the server
--
-- See 'Network.GRPC.Client.withRPC' for making individual RPCs on the new
-- connection.
--
-- The connection to the server is set up asynchronously; the first call to
-- 'withRPC' will block until the connection has been established.
--
-- If the server cannot be reached, the behaviour depends on
-- 'connReconnectPolicy': if the policy allows reconnection attempts, we will
-- wait the time specified by the policy and try again. This implements the gRPC
-- "Wait for ready" semantics.
--
-- If the connection to the server is lost /after/ it has been established, any
-- currently ongoing RPC calls will be closed; attempts at further communication
-- on any of these calls will result in a 'ServerDisconnected' exception being
-- thrown. If that exception is caught, and the 'ReconnectPolicy' allows, we
-- will automatically try to re-establish a connection to the server. This can
-- be especially important when there is a proxy between the client and the
-- server, which may drop an existing connection after a certain period.
--
-- NOTE: The /default/ 'ReconnectPolicy' is 'DontReconnect', as per the gRPC
-- specification of "Wait for ready" semantics. You may wish to override this
-- default.
--
-- Clients should prefer sending many calls on a single connection, rather than
-- sending few calls on many connections, as minimizing the number of
-- connections used via this interface results in better memory behavior. See
-- [well-typed/grapesy#134](https://github.com/well-typed/grapesy/issues/133)
