-- | Kill thread if it is running
--
-- If the thread is in 'ThreadNotStarted' state, we merely change the thread
-- state to 'ThreadException'. We do /NOT/ block, since we cannot be sure if the
-- thread will be started at all (and so we might block indefinitely). This case
-- is taken into account in 'threadBody': if the thread is killed before it is
-- started, 'threadBody' will exit immediately.
--
-- We do not update the thread state here (except in the case of
-- 'ThreadNotStarted'); instead, we rely on the exception handler inside
-- 'threadBody' to do so (we are guaranteed that this thread handler is
-- installed if the thread state is anything other than 'ThreadNotStarted').
--
-- Returns the reason the thread was killed (either the exception passed as an
-- argument to 'cancelThread', or an earlier exception if the thread was already
-- killed), or the thread interface if the thread had already terminated.

--
-- We do /not/ distinguish between 'ThreadDone' and 'ThreadRunning' here, as
-- doing so is inherently racy (we might return that the client is still
-- running, and then it terminates before the calling code can do anything with
-- that information).
